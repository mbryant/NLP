The missiles were fully armed and ready to fly against the cowering Communist dogs . We had our caps in hand and our floating right arms covered in nasty sayings , with muscle - bound necks and ripening fruit baskets beneath our stomping boots . Let me be the one to show these dogs , said the captain , and shoved the button home . Let me be the one , said the first mate , and let fly a monstrous expletive . I sat off to the side , listening with half of my ears , tuned into the short wave . I punctuated my thoughts with corporeal flutterings , fit the rat into the hole , as it were . Sometimes when it gets dark enough in the bunker I can see my thoughts run up the walls , carrying other , weaker thoughts up with them , slung across their shoulders in hasty and not altogether uncivil firemen carries , craggy lines razed beneath their thought - eyes and purportedly purple purposes trailing , ever trailing .
